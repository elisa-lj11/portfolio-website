      <p>
        In my Senior Spring quarter at Stanford in 2019, I took "<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs377e/2019/sp/">CS 377E</a>: Designing Solutions to Global Grand Challenges: Human-Centered AI." In this class, I worked with a team of 4 on a quarter-long project applying design thinking, processes, and tools to the intersection of healthcare and smart technology. Over the course of 10 weeks, we underwent the design journey from ideation to iterating on prototypes to presenting our final product in a public fair, in which we received special recognition for our work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our final product was an app-hosted platform that fostered community cohesion and social capital through a marketplace of projects and skills that allow community members to create and join projects, volunteer time, and further community involvement. Not only was the project fun to work on, but it gave me a fantastic template for how to design and build out a product. I detail this process in the sections below.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Background Research</h2>
      <p>
        Since the goal of the class was to develop a project using human-centered AI to address global challenges, we wanted to apply our technical skills for social good. One of our team members was from Colombia, so we began researching issues in the region. We quickly identified the pressing need to address the impacts of conflict and violence, particularly how these crises affect social infrastructure and community cohesion.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our background research revealed that social infrastructure—such as trust, social cohesion, and self-organization—was a key factor in building community resilience in conflict-affected areas. In Colombia, especially in Buenaventura, a coastal seaport city, communities were grappling with poverty, violence, and unemployment despite the city's importance as a trade hub (Miroff, 2016). Government and NGO efforts often focused on physical infrastructure, but evidence suggested that strengthening social bonds and fostering collaboration within communities was a more effective way to help them recover and thrive (Aldrich & Meyer, 2015).
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Based on these insights, we developed a project aimed at fostering social capital to help communities like Buenaventura become more resilient. We explored using tools like time banking, AI, and blockchain to enable people to exchange skills and services, which would reinforce social ties and support economic self-sufficiency. We were now ready to move to the next phase of needfinding, where we would engage directly with communities to understand their needs and ensure that our app design aligned with their goals.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Needfinding</h2>
      <p>
        We interviewed 8 people in total: 2 from Buenaventura, Colombia and 6 from Palo Alto, California, some of which self-identified as "community leaders" and others as "community members." We wanted to get a sense of the differences between disparate communities, so we hoped that by reaching out to folks in Buenaventura, we could break out of our own Palo Alto bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
        We asked questions about the following 5 topics:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Community Description</b>: Gain insight into the overall characteristics of the community, including its demographics, culture, and unique aspects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Community Problems</b>: Understand the main challenges faced by the community, such as issues related to poverty, violence, or lack of resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interconnectivity</b>: Assess the level of social cohesion within the community and the extent of relationships with other communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Outstanding Members/Projects</b>: Identify key figures or initiatives within the community that are driving positive change or providing valuable services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Applying Social Capital</b>: Explore how social capital is used within the community, and introduce the concept of time banking to gauge their interest in leveraging it for community improvement.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When we completed our interviews, we coalesced our responses into a single spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={needfindingInterviewsImageUrl} alt='Needfinding Interviews' width='60%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        We then started a synthesis process by reviewing our interview notes and writing insights onto sticky notes which we grouped by interviewer. We guided our insights with the overarching question "How might we help communities overcome crises?".
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={initialSynthesisImageUrl} alt='Initial Synthesis' width='50%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        With the visual aid from the sticky notes, we then grouped the insights into categories like leadership qualities, community obstacles, and infrastructure issues, as well as identifying standout "super-members" who took on leadership roles. This process clarified key takeaways and allowed us to form meaningful narratives from our interview data.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={affinityMapImageUrl} alt='Affinity Map' width='70%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        We distilled the insights from our affinity map even further into two empathy maps: one for a community leader, and one for a community member.
      </p>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <figure>
            <img

            alt='Community Leader Empathy Map'
            style={{ width: '70%', display: 'inline-block', marginRight: '2%' }}
          />
          <figcaption>Community Leader Empathy Map</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img
            src={memberEmpathyMapImageUrl}
            alt='Community Member Empathy Map'
            style={{ width: '70%', display: 'inline-block' }}
          />
          <figcaption>Community Member Empathy Map</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Between our affinity map and our empathy maps, we noticed some trends that could be mapped to a 2x2 journey map, where one axis was low versus high community cohesion, and the second axis was leadership versus membership. From these graphs, we realized that a community is able to self-organize when the lines between leadership and membership blur into a state of equal collaboration.
      </p>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>

          />

          />
          <figcaption>Condensed 2x2 Journey Map</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        To conclude our needfinding exercise, we summarized our insights into the following points:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Communities differed mainly in their level of cohesion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low-cohesion communities had clear leaders focused on distributing tasks and resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Medium-cohesion communities saw leaders act as organizers, while members took on larger roles themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          High-cohesion communities governed by consensus, with little distinction between leaders and members.
        </li>
        <li>
          As cohesion increases, leadership skills both influence members and empower new leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technology is used differently across communities, from communication in low-cohesion to collaboration in high-cohesion groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping each other is necessary in low-cohesion communities but voluntary in high-cohesion ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leaders seek recognition in low-cohesion settings, while in higher-cohesion communities, leadership roles are often more understated.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By this point we felt like we had a deep understanding of our community cohesion problem, so we were ready to move onto the next steps of generating "Point of View" and "How Might We?" statements. 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>"Point of View" and "How Might We?" Statements</h2>
      <p>
        We collected the following 3 points of view from a subset of our interviewees:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          "Leonard," a community leader, sees his role as connecting external resources with internal needs. However, his tendency to prioritize external solutions over local talent reveals an opportunity to shift leaders' mindsets towards leveraging internal resources first.
        </li>
        <li>
          "Ashley," an aspiring social worker in Buenaventura, feels that leadership in her community is exclusionary, preventing her from stepping up. Dismantling existing leadership structures could empower new leaders and promote more inclusive community involvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Palo Alto cooperative living members have naturally built a knowledge-sharing network through daily interactions, but unequal distribution of voice within the group shows a need to create a more balanced and collaborative environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We used these POVs to brainstorm 53 "How might we?" statements that we tracked with sticky notes.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={hmwIdeationImageUrl} alt='HMW Ideation' width='100%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        We then reorganized the HMW sticky notes into affinity groups, and as a group we voted on 3 themes to focus on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Members Speak Up
        </li>
        <li>
          Searching for Resources
        </li>
        <li>
          Teaching Skills
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <img src={hmwAffinityGroupingImageUrl} alt='HMW Affinity Grouping' width='100%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        We generated a final set of HMWs from these themes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How might we break up hierarchical community structures that prevent new leaders from speaking up?
        </li>
        <li>
          How might we advertise one's skills more broadly?
        </li>
        <li>
          How might we make people share and recruit skills inside the community? 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Equipped with our finalized HMWs, we moved onto the solution ideation phase of the design process.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Solution Ideation</h2>
      <p>
        We launched another sticky note brainstorm session, this time generating 48 ideas for our 3 HMW groups.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={hmwSolutionBrainstormImageUrl} alt='HMW Solution Brainstorm' width='100%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        As a group we voted for our favorite ideas and landed on 34 options.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={hmwSolutionFinalIdeasImageUrl} alt='HMW Solution Final Ideas' width='60%'/>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        After a final voting round, we landed on the following 4 ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Matching/apprenticeship program for those who want to learn with those who can teach it
        </li>
        <li>
          Place for leaders and community members to post and find skills that they need
        </li>
        <li>
          Pop-up classes/skill teach-ins
        </li>
        <li>
          (Dark horse idea) Hackathon
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From here we moved into an experimental phase to decide which idea would be the best candidate for our project.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Experience Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        We developed 3 experience prototypes based on the outcomes of our solution ideation exercise. For each prototype, we tested a hypothesis over a short week-long timeframe and analyzed our assumptions based on testing results.
      </p>
      <h3>EP 1: Skills and Services Marketplace</h3>
      <img src={e1Prototype1ImageUrl} alt='EP 1 Prototype 1' width='100%'/>
      <br></br>
      <img src={e1Prototype2ImageUrl} alt='EP 1 Prototype 2' width='40%'/>
      <p>
        <b>Hypothesis:</b> If members could know what skills and knowledge their neighbors have, they would be more motivated to ask them for help.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Method:</b> We presented a spreadsheet of skilled community members and available tasks to a Palo Alto co-op member.
      </p>
      <span><b>Results:</b>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (+) Matching people to tasks was intuitive
        </li>
        <li>
          (+) Table of people with skills was easy to read
        </li>
        <li>
          (-) Projects may stagnate if there aren't appropriate skills within the community
        </li>
        <li>
          (-) Without funding, some projects may not be feasible
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span><b>Validity:</b></span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our hypothesis was valid because all available tasks required community members to join in the same space.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new assumption is that some members in the community must start with social capital to post tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>EP 2: Hold a "Hackathon" of Community Service</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Hypothesis:</b> Sharing an activity improves social connection between members and improves the shared understanding of individual skills and knowledge of members of the community.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Method:</b> Group chat “ideation” session with 1 leader and 1 member of Buenaventura. Will community members have a better idea of what skills their neighbors have?
      </p>
      <span><b>Results:</b>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (-) Shared activities surfaces skills and knowledge, but users want to know about the players' intentions!
        </li>
        <li>
          Social goals are more effective recruiting people for shared activities
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span><b>Validity:</b></span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our hypothesis was not valid because members in low cohesion communities struggle to find help in their communities to launch their projects. We found out these communities have scarce knowledge of the skills and knowledge other members have. Can shared activities surface these skills and knowledge?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>EP 3: Creating More Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Hypothesis:</b> If people take ownership over some responsibility, they can develop into leaders.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Method:</b> Chatbot that thrusts users into a (gardening) simulation.
      </p>
      <span><b>Results:</b>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (+) Participation wasn't hard to get, people seemed to like the storyline
        </li>
        <li>
          (-) Texting in the same room was a little awkward, and people who knew the subject weren't as interested
        </li>
        <li>
          Had to go off-script, realized this was almost like role-playing/situation training
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of experience kept leaders humble
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span><b>Validity:</b></span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our hypothesis was valid because the simulation gave participants sense of making quick judgements under stress. However, we didn't find our results to indicate long-term success of emerging leaders.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>EP Outcomes: Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        After testing our 3 experience prototypes, we decided to move forward with EP 1, our "Skills and Services Marketplace" idea. We believed that this EP demonstrated the most promising results and would be the most likely to deliver long-term outcomes for community cohesion. We were ready to move into the initial stages of prototyping.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        At this point in our project, we branded ourselves as <b>Local Hive</b> and described our mission/problem/solution/value proposition:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Mission:</b> Boost your projects and build your own skills with the power of your community.
        <br></br>
        <b>Problem:</b> How can community members support each other when they are not in close physical proximity?
        <br></br>
        <b>Solution:</b> Create a marketplace of projects and skills using volunteering time as currency.
        <br></br>
        <b>Value Proposition:</b> Providing a platform that fosters community cohesion and social capital.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We took to the drawing boards once again to sketch out concepts for our solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Concept Sketches</h3>
      <img src={conceptSketchesImageUrl} alt='Concept Sketches' width='100%' />
      <p>
        Sketches centered around 4 input modalities: web, mobile, AR, existing platform integrations (Slack, iMessage, etc.). We voted on our top two modalities, web and mobile, and proceeded to make more sketches for possible UI.
      </p>
      <h3>UI Sketches</h3>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <figure>
            <img
            src={uiSketch1ImageUrl}
            alt='Mobile UI Sketch 1'
            style={{ width: '90%', display: 'inline-block', marginRight: '2%' }}
          />
          <figcaption>Mobile UI Sketch 1</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img
            src={uiSketch2ImageUrl}
            alt='Mobile UI Sketch 2'
            style={{ width: '90%', display: 'inline-block' }}
          />
          <figcaption>Mobile UI Sketch 2</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', width: '100%', textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <figure>
            <img
            src={uiSketch3ImageUrl}
            alt='Web UI Sketch'
            style={{ width: '40%', display: 'inline-block', marginRight: '2%' }}
          />
          <figcaption>Web UI Sketch</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Once we had our UI sketches laid out, we evaluated their potential using our insights from the needfinding phase of our project and came to the conclusion that a <b>mobile app</b> would be the better selection because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          People already use phones to organize and consume information.
        </li>
        <li>
          A mobile app with push notifications is the most appealing and immediate to users who wish to connect with their community.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is already a pre-existing social networking mental model that people associate with phones.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With our decision made, we moved on to defining our task flows which would help us design a low-level prototype.
      </p>
      <h3>Task Flows</h3>
      <p>In order to structure the screens we needed to create for our low-fi prototype, we defined a set of tasks with increasing difficulty. These would help guide us in our initial UI decisions as well as provide us with direction for what the app should enable a user to accomplish. We sketched a task flow for each task listed to inform our low-fi screen designs.</p>
      <img src={easyTaskFlowImageUrl} alt='Easy Task Flow' width='50%' />
      <br></br>
      <p>
        <b>Easy Task: Joining a project</b>
        <br></br>
        Joining a project involves: signing up, exploring projects, finding a project you are qualified for, joining the project then optionally reaching out to project leader for more information.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={mediumTaskFlowImageUrl} alt='Medium Task Flow' width='50%' />
      <br></br>
      <p>
        <b>Medium Task: Creating a project</b>
        <br></br>
        Creating a project involves: specifying a time, location, the categories of skills involved, compensation awarded and a description for your project then recruiting users and posting the project.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={complexTaskFlowImageUrl} alt='Complex Task Flow' width='50%' />
      <br></br>
      <p>
        <b>Complex Task: Monitoring community involvement</b>
        <br></br>
        Monitoring Community Involvement involves: project leaders monitoring who is contributing to their project and individual users monitoring their own community involvement and contributions made by the overall community.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our task flows defined, we started sketching out the screens we would need for our low-fi prototype.
      </p>
      <h3>Low-Fi Prototype Screens</h3>
      <img src={lowFiOverviewImageUrl} alt='Low-Fi Overview' width='100%' />
      <br></br>
      <p>
        We sketched out 17 separate screens on sheets of paper and used plastic film to create the illusion of buttons and selection. Our design decisions were guided by the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users should be encouraged to work on projects outside their skillset by reaching out, gathering information, and collaborating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meeting people is just as valuable as the work itself, and this is integrated into the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attitudes and intents matter, influencing AI recommendations through goal-based questions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With our low-fi prototype literally in hand, we began testing our app.
      </p>
      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted 20-minute user tests with 3 separate participants of different ages and backgrounds. We asked them to run through our 3 tasks by interacting with our paper prototype and using our "buttons" to make selections. Members of our team took turns operating as an interview facilitator who ran through the task instructions, a "computer" who would manually switch paper screens based on user selections, and a notetaker who logged any critical incidents and successes that occurred during the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical incidents included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The attitudinal screen was confusing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users wanted a screen for specific projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users were only interested in their projects, not in the community status.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Critical successes included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating a project elicited a positive response.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having both people and projects is helpful for users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tree visualization was appreciated as symbolism for community growth.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our major takeaways from our low-fi testing were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (-) The point system needs to be explicit and clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          (-) Navigation between screens needs to be streamlined.
        </li>
        <li>
          (+) The “social network” aspect was intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>
          (+) Joining a community was straightforward.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After this thorough evaluation of our low-fi prototype, we started development on our medium fidelity prototype using our testing insights to redesign our app's user experience.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Medium Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        Going into our med-fi prototype development, we brought a few changes from low-fi testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Giving users a starting amount of points (Honey Money) when they sign up
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding due dates and locations
        </li>
        <li>
          Being able to see experience gained from community involvement
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A major concept that we wanted to put to the test with our med-fi prototype was the time banking point system that we had indexed on since we started work on this project. In our app, we planned to use "Honey Money" as a form of currency. Users would be able to utilize Honey Money to create their own projects and use it as compensation or join projects to earn more. They would start with 50 Honey Moneys, where 10 Honey Moneys would equal one hour of work. Their experience, Honey Money balance, and transaction history would be viewable on a Wallet Page from their profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also wanted to build out a taxonomy of skills. Skills would be taken into account in two situations: when users build their profiles and when they list skills needed for a project. These skills would be categorized into general groups and further divided into specific ones. AI technology would be used to recommend projects users would be qualified for and interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used Figma to build our <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={FIGMA_MEDFI_1_URL}>first med-fi prototype</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      We tested 4 participants on our med-fi prototype, with each study running about 10 minutes as they worked through our 3 tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our test plan aimed to investigate the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather the likeability of a user to complete a task without guidance
        </li>
        <li>
          Gather the excitement of a user to complete a task without guidance
        </li>
        <li>
          Find out what actions are done and in what order
        </li>
        <li>
          Find out if people are more likely to join a project or to create a new project
        </li>
        <li>
          Find out whether people can attend more projects by adjusting the language:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Contribute to your community
            </li>
            <li>
              Meet people today
            </li>
            <li>
              Earn points
            </li>
            <li>
              Learn to do something
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         Our results indicated that we needed to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Simplify the "Honey Money" concept
        </li>
        <li>
          Rephrase onboarding
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a list of sub-tasks left to complete above the join button
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a social media button to accelerate recruiting
        </li>
        <li>
          List required skills on a task
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With these insights we performed one more design iteration to create our <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={FIGMA_MEDFI_2_URL}>second med-fi Figma prototype</a>, then we moved on to our heuristic evaluation phase.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <img src={medFi2FigmaOverviewImageUrl} alt='Med-Fi 2 Figma Overview' width='100%' />
      <br></br>
      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        In this phase of our process we gave our Figma prototype to 4 evaluators who were assigned our 3 tasks and asked to call out any heuristic violations they encountered as they used our prototype. Violations were graded on severity on a 0-4 scale and organized into 10 heuristic categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Visibility of Status
        </li>
        <li>
          Match System & World
        </li>
        <li>
          User Control
        </li>
        <li>
          Consistency
        </li>
        <li>
          Error Prevention
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognition not Recall
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency of Use
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimalist Design
        </li>
        <li>
          Help Users with Errors
        </li>
        <li>
          Documentation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br></br>
      <img src={heuristicViolationsImageUrl} alt='Heuristic Violations Summary' width='100%' />
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Our testers identified 46 heuristic violations altogether and included feedback for what they expected and how they would fix it. An example of a feedback item is below:
      </p>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <p style={{ marginLeft: '10%', marginRight: '10%', textAlign: 'justify' }}>
          <b>[H6: Recognition rather than recall][Severity: 3]</b>
          <br></br>
          <i>Evaluators: 1, 2, 3, 4</i>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          What is the difference between the buzz page and the projects page? It's not intuitive that the buzz page includes projects that you are not currently “enrolled” in. I think that searching for new projects and looking at the ones that you are already signed up for should just all be in the same place. It makes it confusing to need to remember where the different things regarding the projects are.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Fix: Make them one category and have subcategories for searching through projects easily or on the project page having a buzz “someone else” button in addition to a join project button. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We carefully considered each of the 46 violations and designated action items to incorporate into our <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={FIGMA_MEDFI_3_URL}>third med-fi prototype</a> iteration. Our major design changes were grouped into four areas: conceptual clarification, content sizing, information consistency, and task prioritization.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Conceptual Clarification:</b> Simplify onboarding by explaining new app concepts (like Hive and HoneyMoney) while keeping the process concise and visually engaging
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Content Sizing:</b> Declutter pages to ensure that all content was appropriately sized and relevant
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Information Consistency:</b> Standardize key details across screens, such as project skills and status, to avoid confusion
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Task Prioritization:</b> Reorder the home screen to emphasize actionable tasks, like joining or creating a project, over less important information
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To highlight the changes between our 3 med-fi prototypes, below is a progression of our app's home screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        By this point in our process, we were ready to conduct one more round of user research before we would start our final prototype.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <hr className="solid"></hr>
      <br></br>
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of our user research was to gather feedback on how effectively the prototype addressed issues related to creating and joining community projects. We also aimed to ensure that the app's concepts (Hive, HoneyMoney, Buzz, etc.) were clear and useful, and that the information size and overall design were appropriate and visually appealing to users.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We recruited volunteers from four key groups (identified in our needfinding stage) for testing:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Community members:</b> Regular members of communities, where we aimed to observe how the app blurred the line between members and leaders, encouraging them to create projects and recruit others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Community leaders:</b> Potential power-users who already organize community efforts, with a focus on how the app could enhance their actions, encouraging them to join existing projects and help others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Low cohesion/motivation:</b> Members who are less engaged in their communities, to see if the app motivates them to get more involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>High cohesion/motivation:</b> Highly engaged users, to assess how useful the app remains for communities already functioning well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We conducted tests with 4 volunteers in total and summarized their feedback below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The design and Hive theme were well-received, though a few colors in the onboarding process felt out of place.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was some confusion about the scale of projects the app is intended for (large vs. small) and how the "buzzing" feature works.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users appreciated the potential for organizing and tracking both personal and community goals but expressed concerns about whether small communities would have enough engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Suggestions were made to improve realism (e.g., filling in project images) and add more interactive features for sorting and monitoring project progress.
        </li>

          The Honey Moneys system was well-liked as a way to incentivize helping others, but some wanted clearer ways to track involvement and progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For our final iterative pass over our prototype, we decided to prioritize the following changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Improve fidelity</b> so people can be more fully immersed in the app
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Put in real pictures</b> for profiles and projects
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sort by category</b> of tasks on a separate screen
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Declutter</b> by prioritizing tasks
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consistency</b> of key terms like "buzz" across the app
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With this final user study under our belt, we were finally ready to develop and launch our final prototype.

      <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
      <div className="video-vertical" style={{ height: '60%' }}>
        <video controls autoPlay muted>
          <source src={fullAppVideoUrl} type="video/mp4" />
        </video>

        We launched our <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={FIGMA_FINAL_URL}>final Figma prototype</a> in an end-of-quarter project fair.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Alongside our prototype we deployed an <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={APP_WEBSITE_URL}>app website</a> describing our app's functionality and the design process behind it.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <img src={appWebsiteImageUrl} alt='App Website' width='60%'/>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        At the fair, we delivered a 15-minute presentation on our app evolution, and we showcased an accompanying project poster which won "Best Poster" within our cohort of 6 teams.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <img src={posterImageUrl} alt='Poster' width='40%'/>

        I was proud that in just 10 weeks, we started from a nebulous idea of strengthening communities and worked all the way to a robust prototype that we could present to dozens of people. If there had been more time, we would have loved to take our app to the next level by piloting in a real community for ecological validity, building a minimum viable product, then launching a pilot internationally; but, alas, we had other projects to move onto. Still, we could "bee" happy that we got as far as we did in such a short period.

      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Needfinding is a crucial step in product development, but it can easily be overlooked if you're too focused on your initial idea of a solution. To apply human-centered design effectively, it's essential to step outside your own perspective and listen objectively to the needs of your target users before forming assumptions about how they think or what they need.</li>
        <li>
          Just as you shouldn't get too attached to your initial solution, it's important not to cling to the first, second, or even third iteration of a design. User testing will consistently reveal opportunities for improvement, and often, different users will have conflicting preferences. Refining a design requires balancing the needs of the majority without neglecting the minority.
        </li>
        <li>
          While it's important to remain humble, it's also gratifying to acknowledge when your instincts prove correct. We recognized we had a promising idea when we aimed to leverage social capital to foster community growth. Throughout the design process, we made numerous adjustments to the specifics of how "HoneyMoneys" would effectively motivate community members. However, user tests consistently reinforced our belief that using volunteer time as a currency to support community projects was fundamentally a sound approach.
