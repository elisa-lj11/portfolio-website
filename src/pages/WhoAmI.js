          I'm a night owl. When I'm not outside gazing at the stars, wondering how we ended up as these little sentient specks on this vast cosmic canvas floating aimlessly in the ether, I'm up late daydreaming of unconventional ways to make sense of our existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've dabbled in a lot of things: I'm an engineer, a singer, a designer, a festival-goer, a teacher, a pianist, a petsitter, a student, a gaymer, a writer, a long furby enthusiast (not in any particular order). I ask myself "Who am I?" every day, and I wish I could give you a better answer. I guess, in the most abstract sense, I am whoever I am at this exact moment, and any artifacts that remain from my past are just echoes of who I used to be. Maybe a better question is "Who do I want to become?" Now for this, I can give a relatively short answer:
        </p>
        <h3>
          <b>I want to become a person who makes a positive impact in this slice of spacetime that we concurrently experience.</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Anyway, enough armchair philosophizing. Look below to see who I used to be.

              <li>
                I approach new problems with an open mind and a beginner's mentality. When stepping into unfamiliar domains, I've found that I learn best by asking many questions early and often (not sparing the dumb ones). Pairing the humility to admit what I don't know with the curiosity to seek out answers has led me to discover fascinating insights I didn't even realize I was missing.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <b style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Creativity</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why remake something for the thousandth time when we can create work that is novel and engaging? Foundational knowledge is essential for building functionality, but I challenge myself to find new ways to fulfill the original purpose of a design while infusing it with nontraditional methods that make the result not only useful, but delightful.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In a world increasingly shaped by technology and individualism, it's easy to lose sight of our collective roots. We're inherently wired to thrive in community settings, which is why I believe it's crucial to prioritize people in technology design. Technology should foster our connections, not hinder them.

          I am devoted to my tuxedo cat, Azalea (and dearly miss my labradoodle, Zody). We love going for walks—Azalea rides in her "astronaut" cat backpack—and we often enjoy warm afternoon naps in the sun. When I'm not catering to Azalea's whims, I am:

        <p>
          I am a master's student at the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={BERKELEY_URL}>University of California, Berkeley</a> in the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={MDES_URL}>Master of Design</a> program, which emphasizes a critical approach to design and social practice to address the new realities of emerging technologies. Through this program, I aim to explore human-centered design, human-computer interaction, and user interface design, with a focus on creating innovative physical-digital interfaces that facilitate interpersonal connections.

        <img src={spaceGradImageUrl} alt='Space Grad' width='50%'/>
        <p>
          I graduated from <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={STANFORD_URL}>Stanford University</a> with a Bachelor of Science in <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={SYMSYS_URL}>Symbolic Systems</a>, an interdisciplinary program that branches across computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology. My concentration was "Human-Computer Interaction," where I focused on the design, usability, and evaluation of interactive systems, exploring how technology can be better integrated with human needs and behaviors.

        <h3>Zoox</h3>
        <i>May 2026 - August 2026</i>
        <p>
          The summer after my first year at Berkeley, I worked at <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={ZOOX_URL}>Zoox</a>, a robotaxi company building autonomous vehicles from the ground up, as a Creative Technologist intern on the Experience Design team, where I supported the team's design work on in-vehicle rider experiences by developing interactive software and hardware prototypes. The prototyping tools I created accelerated prototype building and iteration alongside designers, covering everything from designing and previewing animations and audio to deploying them to hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collaborated closely with designers, researchers, and engineers to translate concepts into testable demos, and I contributed to internal design reviews and cross-functional presentations that helped the team evaluate and refine experience concepts. Working in a fast-paced physical product environment, I developed skills in rapid prototyping, tooling development, hardware experimentation, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and AI-augmented workflows.

        <p>
          I left Strivr in January 2024 to explore my dream of living remotely on a farm in Panamá through the volunteer program <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={WWOOF_URL}>WWOOF</a>. Motivated to connect to my Panamanian roots by learning Spanish, and inspired by my video game experience with virtual farming in <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={STARDEW_URL}>Stardew Valley</a>, I moved to Boquete, a mountainous region famous for its coffee. Four months of real-life farming later, I realized it was, unsurprisingly, more fun in a video game, so I returned to California to figure out my next steps. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After a period of soul-searching, I decided to apply to graduate school and was accepted into UC Berkeley's Master of Design program for emerging technology. In the meantime, I worked as a barista to learn both the craft of coffee-making and the art of small talk, volunteered at the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href={EXPLORATORIUM_URL}>Exploratorium</a> (a public learning laboratory blending science and art), and traveled through Europe with family.
